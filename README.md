# Spartan3A-Vending-Machine

Used the DIP Switches on the Elbert V2 Board to assign the price for each item. Implemented the 7 Segment Display to output the price of the items. The Push Buttons were used to input the money (nickel, dime, quarter, dollar). At last, the LEDs are a way for the user to know in which state they are (reset, add, input money, etc). 
Added VGA support to display Project Name
